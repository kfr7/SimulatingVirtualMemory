# SimulatingVirtualMemory
Simulate interaction between physical memory and virtual memory.

HOW TO RUN:
(Program uses Python so it will be needed to be downloaded
on the system)
1) Place both of the commands text files in the same directory as "virtual_memory.py"
2) Name the first text file: "first.txt"
3) Name the second text file (one with VM addresses): "second.txt"
4) In terminal, change directories into the directory 
    which contains both files, and 
    enter "python3 virtual_memory.py" or (depends on machine)
    "python virtual_memory.py" and if you want to redirect it 
    to a file, "python3 virtual_memory.py > output.txt"

LIST OF FILES IN ZIP:
1) "virtual_memory.py": main python file that has ALL the code
    needed to compute physical memory addresses given
    virtual memory addresses.
2) "README.md": describes how to run and list of files in zip
